# Plumee and the Quest of the Missing Nest
An original GBA game based on my unfinished prototype of a scrolling platforming game on Scratch.

# The game
Story: Plumee the bird comes back to his nest from going out to lunch. However, he is shocked to find that his nest has gone missing. He finds footprints nearby the tree, and decides to follow them to get his nest back!

## Technical Aspects
This game is going to be my most technically advanced GBA game. It will of course, use HeartLib. The game will have four worlds, each with eight levels. The sound engine will be MaxMod. The game will be a parallax side-scrolling platformer. There will be a working hud created using sprites. The game will be written in C, and compiled with DevKitARM. There will be some LZ77 compression.
